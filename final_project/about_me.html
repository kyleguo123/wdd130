        <p>Throughout high school, I was not sure what I wanted to do for my future career. When I started to find a job, I realized it is hard to find a good job when you don't have useful skills. At the same time, I told myself that I must study hard to find a good job for my future career. While looking at the offered fields, I found programming would be a good major for me to study. Once I started to learn to code in college, I was more certain that I love to become a programmer. Learning how to solve everyday problems with coding is an interesting part of this field.
        
        

            My name is Kyle Guo and I am from China. I am currently living in Rexburg Idaho and studying at BYUI. I am going to get my bachelor's Degree in computer science. I am planning on getting graduated on April 2026. I am looking for internships during my school years, something related to programming or computer engineering. 
            
            On the next page, I will provide my resume, education level, and a list of skills.</p>
