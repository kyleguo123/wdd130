      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Employers don't give a lot of effort when looking into a resume, or even give you much time to show 
        all your accomplishments and projects. If only there was a place to put all of that information in one
         place. Well, there is! Have you ever thought about a personal portfolio website? I have years of experience 
         in programming and web development and will be able to design a website fitted to you, pleasing to employers, 
         where you can store projects, career overflows, contact information, and even a little bit about yourself. 
         You will want to be a step above your competition and it is such an easy decision.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience would be potential employers I am hoping will hire me to work
          for their company. These people are going to need a simple and an easy way to look
          at all my accomplishments and skills. The employers are going to be in either 
          the business or tech field with experience in both. I will need to try and appeal 
          to what they are looking for in an employee so, this website needs to be very 
          professional.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout high school, I was not sure what I wanted to do for my future career. When I started to find a job, I realized it is hard to find a good job when you don't have useful skills. At the same time, I told myself that I must study hard to find a good job for my future career. While looking at the offered fields, I found programming would be a good major for me to study. Once I started to learn to code in college, I was more certain that I love to become a programmer. Learning how to solve everyday problems with coding is an interesting part of this field.
