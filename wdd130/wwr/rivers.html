                <p>1.I had a lot of fun when I came here with my friends and family! I would love to come back again and definitely encourage others to come!</p>
                <p>2.I love any water activity and find it hard to find the best place to river raft. This was by far the best place that I have river rafted! The tour guides were also very patient and kind to my 10 year old daughter who was having trouble getting used to the way the boat work with the river. This was a wonderful place for my children to go and I recommend other parents to bring their children here too. </p>
                <p>3.This place was a good place to go river rafting. We did however have to wait a long time till we finally were on the river. One of the tour guides told me that it is the busy season though. I would highly suggest booking a time ahead to go so you wouldn’t have to wait as long. Overall, it was worth the wait.        </p>
                <p>4.I love river rafting and am very adventurous. I also love crazy rapids. What I found that made this place different than others was in the fact the tour guides took us to the heavier rapids when we asked him to. He warned us of the dangers and we have white water rafted before which we told him. He was understanding and so then allowed it to happen. Although, if you are a beginner to white water rafting, don’t tell the tour guides to take you to the crazy rapids.</p>
